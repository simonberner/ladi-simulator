A little [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball) game simulator which generates some mock data to show how that live data can be displayed with live activities on the lock screen and in the dynamic island.

## Functionality
This App shows Live Activity (live data updates):
- On the lock screen and on devices that don't support the Dynamic Island, a banner on top of the screen.
- in the compact version of the dynamic island
- in the expanded version of the dynamic island
Dynamic Island: On devices that support the Dynamic Island (see list below), the App displays Live Activities on the leading and trailing side of the TrueDepth camera.

## Definitions
- LA: Live Activity
- LAs: Live Activities
- DI: Dynamic Island
- [Golden State Warriors](https://www.nba.com/warriors): is the home team
- [Chicago Bulls](https://www.nba.com/bulls): is the guest team.

## Tech Stack
- Xcode 14.2
- Swift 5.7.2

## Frameworks
- SwiftUI
- [WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/WidgetKit)
- [ActivityKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit)

## Device and OS Compatibility
LAs are iPhone only.
- For LA: iPhone with iOS 16.1+
- For DI: iPhone 14 Pro/Pro Max with iOS 16.1+

## Architecture
This project is build upon the [Model-View architecture](https://quickbirdstudios.com/blog/swiftui-architecture-redux-mvvm/) and uses the following [architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern):
- Model View State architectural pattern ([MV State](https://azamsharp.com/2022/08/09/intro-to-mv-state-pattern.html)): the GameView is observing state changes in the GameModel and rerenders its UI accordingly.
(Reservation: we don't inject the aggregated root model as global object using `@EnvironmentObject` because we only have one View here)

## Design Patterns
In this project the following [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are used:
- [Delegation Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern)
We know the [Delegate and Protocol Pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiOKO8ta1n4) best from UIKit. Here we use it as 1to1 communication pattern in order that the GameModel class (as the delegate) can communicate with the GameSimulator class.

## How does it work?
- By pressing the _Start Game Sim_, the GameSimulator "factory" spits out a new GameState every 2 seconds
- The GameView and the Live Activity updates with every (new) GameState change
- The GameModel is (the glue) between the GameView and the GameSimulator
- The GameSimulator stops automatically after 120 ball possessions in total

## Learnings
### Live Activities
- [Apple doc: Displaying live data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities)
- Live activities can live for up to 8 hours at max.
- Completed (final state) Live Activity will stay on the Lock Screen for 4 hours.
- Live Activity has to be launched while the App is in the foreground.
- Live Activity can be updated while the App is running in the background.
- Live Activities are not Widgets but we need WidgetKit to build them with Widget Extension.
- It is highly likely that one is going to have also a Widget in combination with Live Activities.
- Live Activity vs Widget: a Widget can update itself, as a LA have to be updated from within the App.
- As soon you create a Widget Extension including LA, Xcode will generate some [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) for you.
- When more than one LA is active the system chooses which LAs are visible and displays two using the minimal presentation
- IMPORTANT: In the App Target in the Info.plist we have to add the Key: `Supports Live Activities` and set its value to `True`
### Any, AnyObject, any
- AnyObject and Any are used for type erasure
- [AnyObject, Any, and any: When to use which?](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/anyobject-any/)
#### AnyObject
- All classes, class types, or class-only protocols can use `AnyObject` as their concrete type.
- If possible try to use concrete types as it is more readable to your friends.
- By using it as our destination, we always need to cast and consider casting failures using the default implementation.
- Try to use concrete protocol instead, see [here](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/anyobject-any/#when-to-use-anyobject)
#### Any 
- An instance of any type including function types can use `Any`.
- `Any` is even more flexible than `AnyObject` by allowing you to cast instances of any type, but it makes code harder to predict and optimize for performance compared to using concrete types.
- [Dynamic memory is required to make this possible, taking away the possibility for the compiler to optimize this piece of code.](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/anyobject-any/#when-to-use-any)
#### any
- [When to use any?](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/anyobject-any/#when-to-use-any)
### Type Erasure
- [Type Erasure in Swift](https://www.donnywals.com/understanding-type-erasure-in-swift/)
### Nice to know
- [Architecture vs Architectural Patterns vs Design Patterns](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-architectural-style-architectural-patterns-and-design-patterns/)
- Architecture: An architecture shows how we organize our code, or how the system will look like from 10000 meters above from the highest level of abstraction of our system design.
- Architectural Patterns: Are broad solutions how we can implement the chosen architecture.
- Design Patterns: Are accumulative best practices and experiences that developers used over the years to solve general problems.

## Testing
I use the [Arrange, Act and Assert Pattern](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/) for Unit Testing.

## Code Comments
I like putting in the effort of adding comments to my code, [here is why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NEa-OcsTow).

## Pull Requests
When I create PRs I stick to [this guideline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sfzAOfY8uc).
